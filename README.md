This is my xtra work containing the utility functions and other useful stuff that i frequently need
I'll frequently update this repo and add useful function utility functions in javascript, jquery and php. The first funciton i am adding is MobileNumberValidate-
This funciton has regex to check the particular mobile number is an indian mobile number. This is just regex it doesn't dial the number and check whether its in service or not, it has logic code that validate the number like it should be 10 digit and should start from 9,8 or 7.
